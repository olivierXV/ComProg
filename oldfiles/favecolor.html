        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Favorite Colors</h1>
        <h1 style="color: white; background-color: crimson;">Pink</h1>
        <p style="color: white; background-color: crimson;">- The color pink is a pale tint of red often associated with love, compassion, and femininity. The color pink became my favorite when I was exploring my sexual identity and because of the 2022 elections. For me the color pink symbolized hope, hope that some day I'll be accepted by my mother for who I really am. I also hope that someday people would realize that the people would realize that the Marcoses are a family of thieves, murderers, and that the so-called Marcos legacy is a fraud built from lies.</p>
        <h1 style="color: white; background-color: darkRed;">Red</h1>
        <p style="color: white; background-color:darkred;">- The color red represents strength, blood, and passion. Red is my favorite because  it represents blood and strength but also as a symbol of courage, courage and strength that many people had throughout history. </p>
